# National Park Explorer

This single-page application has a full-screen Google Map that displays markers for all of the national parks in the USA.  It integrates with 3rd party API information to display in a markerâ€™s info window when clicked.

## Features

* 3rd party information sources can be enabled and disabled.  The application is designed in a way to easily accommodate more sources that are selectable to be included in the info window.
* 3rd party information is cached so that a request will not be sent again for the same information.
* Clean design.  The navigation menu slides in and out to save room.

## How to use

Open the index.html file. The application is all contained within this page.
